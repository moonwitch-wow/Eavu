#Eavu

My personal setup, with bits and pieces from everywhere.

It includes the following libraries:
- LibStub
- CallBackhandler
- LibDatabroker
- LibCargoShip

I am in the middle of a massive overhaul, so nothing really works. Yes, I could have tagged and worked in a dev branch. Actually, I should have. But this is my personal little worker for WoW so it's ok.
